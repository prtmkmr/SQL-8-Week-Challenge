This repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented in the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Data with Danny. Each week, I tackled a different SQL challenge that required me to use SQL to analyze data and solve real-world business problems.

## Introduction

SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis, and this repository documents my journey through the 8 Week SQL Challenge. 
Each challenge presented unique datasets and problem statements, allowing me to practice my SQL skills and learn new techniques.

## Challenges

Here is a list of the challenges I completed during the 8 Week SQL Challenge:

1. [Week 1: Danny's Diner](week1-dannys-diner)
2. [Week 2: Pizza Runner](week2-pizza-runner)
3. [Week 3: Foodie-Fi](week3-foodie-fi)
4. [Week 4: Data Bank](week4-data-bank)
5. [Week 5: Pizza Metrics](week5-pizza-metrics)
6. [Week 6: Pizza Metrics 2](week6-pizza-metrics-2)
7. [Week 7: CFDs & Record Breaking](week7-cfds-and-record-breaking)
8. [Week 8: User Churn](week8-user-churn)

## Getting Started

To explore my solutions and try the challenges yourself, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-week-sql-challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific challenge folder you're interested in (e.g., `week1-dannys-diner`).

3. Inside each challenge folder, you will find SQL scripts and related files for that specific challenge.

4. Use your preferred SQL database or tool to run the SQL scripts and explore the solutions.

## Challenges Overview

Each challenge folder contains the following files:

- `solution.sql`: The SQL script that contains my solution to the challenge.
- `schema.sql`: The SQL script that defines the database schema used in the challenge.
- `README.md`: A detailed README file for each challenge, including the problem statement, my approach, and the SQL queries used.

## Solution Overview

In the README file for each challenge, you will find:

- A description of the challenge and the business problem it addresses.
- The database schema used for the challenge.
- A step-by-step explanation of my approach and thought process.
- SQL queries used to solve the challenge.
- Any additional insights or observations from the data analysis.
